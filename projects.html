    <p><a href ="CadeiraAI.github.io" target = "_blank">Cadeira AI</a> was designed to facilitate the booking process for businesses. The most common way to make reservations in the United States is through phone calls and keeping someone on the phone taking reservations all day is a time-consuming task. Small and medium-sized companies, especially those in the restaurant industry, encounter difficulties in managing incoming calls efficiently. This challenge is primarily attributed to the constrained availability of their phone lines due to the business's limited working hours. As a result, the phone lines often find themselves occupied, preventing the company from handling more than one call simultaneously. The combination of restricted operational hours and the limitation of handling only a single call at a time creates hurdles in providing timely and effective communication with customers, potentially leading to missed business opportunities and customer dissatisfaction. <br>
    My work at Cadeira AI consists of website development and product development. Utilizing python and Java to create the product was fundamental to its success. Our product was submitted to the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2024 and we are currently waiting for our results.

    <p>For our Statistics project, we were tasked with creating a comprehensive study involving a minimum of 10 variables, focusing on describing the relationships within those variables. Our primary objective was to develop a project of significant impact, leading us to delve deeply into the exploration of how individuals allocate their time. The intricacies of time allocation, influenced by myriad factors, play a pivotal role in shaping one's quality of life.Notably, we observed shifts in working hours and preferences, accompanied by a surge in sentiments of solitude. These changes contributed to elevated rates of suicide and adverse effects on immune well-being. This exploration unveiled a paradoxical consequence of technological advancements. While technological innovations have extended our lifespans, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies has paradoxically fostered a heightened sense of loneliness among individuals.Our research journey revealed the nuanced effects of our reliance on technology, where the convenience of phone-based communication, albeit simplifying life, prompts reflection on the potential social costs. The transition from face-to-face interactions to virtual exchanges raises profound questions about the nature of our interconnectedness and the evolving dynamics of our social fabric. <br><a href="https://github.com/DanteSc03/Time-Spent" target= "_blank">Code</a>

            <p>As the Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://brewstop.github.io/"  target= "_blank">Brewstop</a>, a pioneering company specializing in magnetic tea steeping devices, I spearheaded the 3D modeling team and played a pivotal role in product development, including successfully filing a utility patent for our innovative creations. Over the course of my tenure at Brewstop, I not only honed my skills in advanced 3D modeling using tools such as Onshape and SOLIDWORKS but also developed a profound understanding of the intricacies involved in creating state-of-the-art 3-Dimensional models for our unique range of products. My role extended beyond design as I actively participated in data collection, conducting rigorous testing to ensure the quality and functionality of our devices. Additionally, I had the opportunity to showcase our groundbreaking products at various events, presenting to diverse audiences and receiving valuable feedback that further contributed to the refinement and success of our offerings. The experiences gained during my tenure at Brewstop have transcended my professional life, turning me into an avid 3D modeler even during my spare time. This passion for creating intricate and visually appealing models has become a personal pursuit, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of 3D design.
