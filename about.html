    <p>Born and raised in Southern California. I was fortunate to be exposed to French and Spanish simultaneously as I attended school. As a young boy, my interests included surfing, playing tennis, and 3D modeling. My passion for tennis led me to become a top-ranked player in the United States and a CIF doubles champion in my senior year. For middle school, I attended the San Diego French American School, and for high school, I enrolled at La Jolla Country Day School. My love for 3D modeling manifested in the creation of BrewStop, a project my colleague, Henry Timmermann, initiated . Given my affinity for math and the Spanish culture, I decided to apply to various colleges in Spain. Currently, I am a second-year BBA + Data Analytics student at the Universidad de Navarra in Spain.

    <p>I have always been an active person, constantly seeking outdoor adventures and embracing the activities that life has to offer. Camping with my father on the weekends was a favorite weekend activity. Tennis was my primary passion until I realized the importance of applying myself more in school, as I didn't want tennis to become my full-time career. My parents supported this decision, encouraging me to continue playing, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. I persevered and emerged as a top-ranked high school tennis player, ultimately winning the CIF doubles championship. This achievement marked one of the highlights of my high school career, serving as the culmination of my competitive journey in the United States. During my freshman year, I discovered my passion for 3D modeling, initiating a period where I designed anything with a practical aspect that came to mind. This passion not only made me a key player on the team but also carried over into my innovation classes.

    <p>I am currently enrolled at the University of Navarra, pursuing a degree in Business Administration with a specialization in Data Analytics. Through this program, I have had the opportunity to unleash my potential in the realm of data by coding various projects and learning multiple programming languages. As a member of the Google Developer Student Club, I actively contribute to projects in Python and other languages, further enhancing my coding skills. In our Statistics course, we conducted a thorough analysis of time spent, utilizing the R programming language for a comprehensive study. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have taken on an internship at Orca Systems Inc., where I have begun to apply my education to real-world applications. Prioritizing both knowledge acquisition and hands-on experiences has been crucial for my growth and achieving my goals. I am passionate about coding websites and consistently seek opportunities to learn and expand my skill set.

    <p>During my high school years at La Jolla Country Day School in La Jolla, California, I actively participated in various aspects of school life. I was a member of the robotics team, played on the varsity tennis team for all four years, and contributed to the innovation lab. My classes were diverse, allowing me to uncover my passions in different areas throughout high school. Being a part of the tennis team provided a sense of continuity, allowing me to continue training with friends I had grown up with. The team dynamic filled a void I had felt during my years of individual competitions. The innovation lab was one of my favorite places to be. Converting my imaginative ideas into reality fueled my creativity. During my time in the innovation lab, I embarked on various projects, each with a different level of success. I found my strength in coding and 3D modeling, thriving as I learned different programs such as OnShape and Python. One of the most successful projects was BrewStop. Collaborating with my colleague, Henry Timmermann, we transformed his idea into a functioning reality. We navigated through the patent process and are currently in the production phase. Throughout my years at Country Day, I discovered my love for math and innovation, shaping the path that has led me to where I am today.
