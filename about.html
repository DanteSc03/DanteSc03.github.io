    <p>Born and raised in beautiful Southern California by my Spanish and French parents Natacha and Nicolas. Due to my parents cultures I was taught spanish and french at the same time as i was attending school. Everyone always told me how lucky I was but I never understand how true this was until now. As a young boy I enjoyed Surfing, playing tennis and 3D modeling. My passion for tennis led me to being a top ranked player in the United States and a Cif double champion my senior year. I attended the San Diego French American School for middle school and attended La Jolla Country Day School for high school. My passion for 3D modeling led me to create BrewStop with a colleague of mine Henry Timmermann. Being one that loved math and Spanish culture I decided to apply to various colleges in Spain. I am currently a second year BBA + Data Analytics student at the Universidad de Navarra in Spain.

    <p>I have always been an active child constantly wanting to be outdoors and take advantage of the activities that life has to offer. Camping with my father on the weekends was one of my favorite activities though sometimes it would scare my mother. Playing tennis was my passion until I realized I needed to apply myself a bit more at school because I didn't want tennis to become my full time job. My parents supported my decision and encouraged me to keep playing which was difficult through the pandemic. Fortunately I stuck with it and became a top ranked High School tennis player and even won the CIF doubles championship. This was one of the best moments of my High School career as it was the last competition that I was attending in the states. I discovered my passion for 3D modeling freshman year where I started to design anything I could come up with that had a practical aspect to it. This helped me be a key player on the team and continued in my innovation classes.

    <p>During my high school career I attended La Jolla Country Day School in La Jolla, California. I was a part of the robotics team, the varsity tennis team for all four years and was a part of the innovation lab. I took a wide variety of classes unvcovering my passions in each part of high school. Being on the tennis team allowed me to continue training with the people who I grew up with. The team aspect was what I had been missing through all of my years of individual competitions. The innovation lab was one of my favorite places to be. Learning how to turn my imagination into reality allowed me to continue being a creative person. Throughout these years in the innovation lab I made various projects each with a different level of success. Coding and 3D modeling was where I thrived. Learning different programs such as OnShape and python became a clear passion of mine. BrewStop was the most succesful project. Along with my colleague Henry Timmermann we turned his idea into a functioning reality. We went through the patent process and are in the production process at the moment. Throughout my years at Country Day I uncovered my love for math and innovation which has led me to where I am today.
