    <p>Born and raised in beautiful Southern California by my Spanish and French parents Natacha and Nicolas. Due to my parents cultures I was taught spanish and french at the same time as i was attending school. Everyone always told me how lucky I was but I never understand how true this was until now. As a young boy I enjoyed Surfing, playing tennis and 3D modeling. My passion for tennis led me to being a top ranked player in the United States and a Cif double champion my senior year. I attended the San Diego French American School for middle school and attended La Jolla Country Day School for high school. My passion for 3D modeling led me to create BrewStop with a colleague of mine Henry Timmermann. Being one that loved math and Spanish culture I decided to apply to various colleges in Spain. I am currently a second year BBA + Data Analytics student at the Universidad de Navarra in Spain.

    <p>I have always been an active child constantly wanting to be outdoors and take advantage of the activities that life has to offer. Camping with my father on the weekends was one of my favorite activities though sometimes it would scare my mother. Playing tennis was my passion until I realized I needed to apply myself a bit more at school because I didn't want tennis to become my full time job. My parents supported my decision and encouraged me to keep playing which was difficult through the pandemic. Fortunately I stuck with it and became a top ranked High School tennis player and even won the CIF doubles championship. This was one of the best moments of my High School career as it was the last competition that I was attending in the states. I discovered my passion for 3D modeling freshman year where I started to design anything I could come up with that had a practical aspect to it. This helped me be a key player on the team and continued in my innovation classes.
